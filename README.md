[Reusable Pattern Portfolio]

#A living document of Responsive Deliverables

Inspired by the recent movement of creating systems, not pages. This is a living library of deliverables that can be stylized to fit your next project. Each pattern is included within the pattern directory and can be optionally included into the final guide.
